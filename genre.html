<header> Genre can help you understand your specific discourse community. </header>
    
<p class= body> A discourse community is “a group of people who have the same goal or interest.” For example, members of a club are a part of a discourse community. Millikin students also share a discourse community. Discourse communities “often [develop] communal practices or beliefs to aid their effort. These means can be both apparent (specialized genres) or invisible (language practices).”</p>
  
    
<p class= body> A specialized genre of…</p>
<ul>
<li> the journalism discourse community is news articles.</li>
<li>a business discourse community is memos.</li>
<li>a healthcare professional discourse community is patient charts.</li>
<li>A gaming discourse community is game walkthroughs.</li>
</ul>
    
<p class= body> A language practice in…</p>
<ul>
<li> a journalism discourse community is writing in APA format and using attributions (He said…).</li>
<li>a business discourse community is the specific jargon they may use, like Key Performance Indicator (KPI) or Return on Investment (ROI). </li>
<li>a healthcare professional discourse community is technical terms like “hypertension” and “abrasion.” </li>
<li>A gaming discourse community is slang terms like “GG” (good game) or “AFK” (away from keyboard).
</li>
</ul>
<p class= body> A discourse community can be hard to acclimate to. There might be words you aren’t familiar with, terms you don’t understand, and activities you don’t know how to do. Instead of going into it blind, there are ways to utilize genre to understand discourse communities better and become more literate in the community. Specifically, genre research and genre conventions can assist you in becoming more <href> </href>literate.</p>
