<header> What is a Genre? </header>
    
<p class= body> When you think of genres, you may think of music genres, book genres, or movie genres, but those are only one subsection of genres. Genres <a href= "https://www.isuwriting.com/_files/ugd/395fc9_d3bb019804cf422c8c8973790766be14.pdf">“can be anything [that] responds to a [recurring] situation and has characteristics that make it recognizable”</a> (47). For example, there are genres of pencils. There are colored pencils, mechanical pencils, watercolor pencils, and many more kinds; all of these are a genre of pencil.</p>
<p class= body>So, take a second to think about something that responds to a recurring situation and has defined characteristics. Then think about the subsections and different kinds of that thing. Boom! Genres.</p>
