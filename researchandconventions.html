<header> Genre Research</header>
    
<p class= body>In Jessica Kruel’s <a href= "https://www.isuwriting.com/_files/ugd/395fc9_3f5243c758414bd9854b06589086e8aa.pdf">"'You Want Me to Do What?': The Trials and Errors of Coding,"</a> she discusses how coding can be a genre. To help her learn how to code, she broke the challenging topic into genres. To begin, Kruel conducted genre research by <a href= "https://www.isuwriting.com/_files/ugd/395fc9_3f5243c758414bd9854b06589086e8aa.pdf">“researching the information and tools that are required or would be useful in creating a text within a particular genre”</a> (151). First, she studied the genre of tags in coding. Tags are the specific pieces of code that tell the computer what to do. From her research, she began to learn what body, h1, and p tags meant. Being able to simply identify tags will help her when coding. Now, when Kruel sees any phrase encased in these bracket, she knows it is text that will go directly on the website. After learning about tags through genre research, she <a href= "https://www.isuwriting.com/_files/ugd/395fc9_3f5243c758414bd9854b06589086e8aa.pdf">“had an incredibly basic understanding of what tags [she] needed to simply create and define the boundaries of a web page”</a> and decided it was time to try and create a website (152). From genre research and a little bit of outside research, Kruel was able to create an incredibly simple website, but it was a website. Genre research was imperative in Kruel’s journey to learning code.

<header> Genre Conventions</header>
<p class= body>In Manuel Reza’s <a href= "https://www.isuwriting.com/_files/ugd/395fc9_d3bb019804cf422c8c8973790766be14.pdf">“Understanding Magic: The Gathering Commander Through Genre and Community,”</a> he recounts his journey of understanding the original tabletop version of Magic: The Gathering (MTG) using genre studies. MTG is a card game, like Pokémon. Reza was familiar with an online version of MTG, Brawl, but decided he wanted to immerse himself in the MTG discourse community more and learn how to build a tabletop MTG deck of cards. To do this, he used genre conventions— features <a href= "https://www.isuwriting.com/_files/ugd/395fc9_d3bb019804cf422c8c8973790766be14.pdf">“make a thing recognizable as a part of a distinct genre”</a>— to compare and contrast the tabletop MTG deck genre and the Brawl deck genre (47). To compare the genre conventions, he made a table that clearly shows the similarities between the two decks.
</p>
    
<img src = images/pic.png class= "pic">
    
<p class= body>The similarities between the two MTG decks helped Reza break down how to create his new deck. Through this genre convention analysis, Reza found out that he can use a Brawl deck as a base for his MTG tabletop deck. From there, he had to research more into the tabletop MTG deck genre to specialize it to the tabletop game. Ultimately, this newfound knowledge allowed Reza to broaden his knowledge in the MTG discourse community. Learning to create an MTG tabletop deck made Reza more literate in the community, and now he can converse (and play) with more people.

<p class= body>By utilizing genre research and conventions, anyone can learn a genre within a discourse community. Learning about these genres will ultimately help you acclimate to your discourse community quickly and in the long run. </p>

<header> Examples </header>
    
<p class= body> Below are some different discourse communities. I will be conducting genre research and looking at genre conventions to show how easy it is to understand specific things within a discourse community. </p>


<div class="row">
  <div class="ccolumn" style="background-color:#F3DAD8;">
    <h2>Genre of <i>classes</i></h2>
<p class= box> Dr Bates classes</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>In-class discussion led by the teacher</li>
<li>Lots of writing and busy work to understand a concept
</li>
<li>Schedule is subject to change, and she updates it timely and when needed, can be found at the top of Moodle in an often-updated document
</li>
</ul>            
<p class= box> Dr. Magagna classes </p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible but must communicate in a timely manner </li>
<li>Long student-led in-class discussions</li>
<li>Long analytical papers that are open-ended</li>
<li>Schedule rarely changes - can be found in the syllabus and structured in Moodle</li>
</ul>  
<p class= box> Dr. Hollis-George classes</p>
<ul>
<li>Stern but can be flexible with communication</li>
<li>Lecture classes, minimal long class discussion</li>
<li>Long-ish analytical papers that are semi-open-ended</li>
<li>Schedule rarely changes - can be found in the syllabus
</li>
</ul>  
<p class= box> Similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>All use Moodle</li>
<li>Weekly homework assignments</li>
<li>Expectations of students are high</li>
<li>Require time management skills</li>
<li>In-person classes</li>
</ul> 
<p class= box> Examples of language practices: “Moodle” and “syllabus.”</p> 
<p class= box> If you are familiar with the different genres of English class you are entering, you’ll know a rough outline of what classes will look like on a weekly basis, how much homework you’ll have, and the workload for the class.</p>     
      
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#F3DAD8;">
    <h2>Genre of <i>sorority events</i></h2>

<p class= box> I am in a sorority, and for this genre analysis, I will be using my specific sorority, Alpha Chi Omega Upsilon. This is subject to change in the different sororities on campus or around the world.</p>
<br> 
<p class= box>Siblinghoods</p>
<ul>
<li>No fines attached</li>
<li>Lighthearted and fun, rarely super serious</li>
<li>You can come and go, you will not be required to stay the whole time.</li>
<li>Excuse: none, sometimes it is practice to give the organizer a heads up.
</li>
</ul>            
<p class= box> Required Events </p>
<ul>
<li> $30 fines attached</li>
<li>Sometimes super serious, but most of the time, there is some fun</li>
<li>Oftentimes, you can come and go, but it is standard practice that you stay for the whole event.</li>
<li>Submit an excuse with a valid photo; if there is no proof, you will not get the points. </li>
</ul>  
<p class= box> Golden Lyre events</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 fines attached</li>
<li>Super serious</li>
<li>You cannot come and go, sometimes, if you can’t make it to some of it, you won’t be able to go to any of it.</li>
<li>You must submit photo proof, and sometimes you will have to go to standards to get this excuse approved. </li>
</ul>  
<p class= box> Similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>All address participation within the sorority</li>
<li>There is a clear structure and rules for all of them</li>
<li>All have attitude expectations</li>
<li>All use the same “event” lingo</li>
</ul> 
<p class= box> Examples of language practices: “points” and “siblinghoods.”</p> 
<p class= box> Not only did using genre study work for Reza and Kruel, but it worked for me too. It is a hard task to understand events within my sorority. There are so many of them that look the same from the outside, but are very different when you look at the details. Above are the different kinds of events. Now, since I understand the different genres, I can easily identify the events and know what I should expect and how to get out of them if needed. This has come in handy since people seek me out to help them understand specific events. Because I understand this genre so well, I am seen as one of the “higher-ups” and a mature member of my sorority. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="jcolumn" style="background-color:#F3DAD8;">
    <h2>Genre of <i>journalism articles</i></h2>
      
<p class= box>Column</p>
<ul>
<li>Vary in length</li>
<li>The authors opinion</li>
<li>Quotes and interviews are not required</li>
<li>Can be lighthearted</li>
</ul>            
<p class= box>Feature</p>
<ul>
<li>Long articles</li>
<li>No bias</li>
<li>Quotes and interviews required; more than three interviews are encouraged.</li>
<li>Can be lighthearted</li>
</ul>  
<p class= box> News Story</p>
<ul>
<li>Vary in length</li>
<li>No bias</li>
<li>Quotes and interviews required</li>
<li>Cannot be lighthearted.</li>
</ul>  
<p class= box> Similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require writing and comprehension skills</li>
<li>To prepare, you must gather information</li>
<li>Professionalism is needed in all types</li>
</ul> 
<p class= box> Examples of language practices: “bias” and the titles of the genres (column, feature, and news story).</p> 
<p class= box> The genre of articles is very broad, but understanding the difference between them is imperative if you are in the journalism discourse community. If you don’t understand the genres, then you may try to mix a news story and a column, which is a huge issue. If you are trying to inform an audience by writing a news story, inserting your opinions into it is bad. Let the people think for themselves; don’t draw conclusions for them—that is what columns are for. </p>  
</div>
  <div class="dcolumn" style="background-color:#F3DAD8;">
    <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
<p class= box> Understand genres for a discourse community you are a part of!</p>
<ol>
<li>Think of what discourse community you would like to analyze. </li>
<li>Identify what genre in this discourse community you want to look at.</li>
<li>Begin the genre research and find specifics</li>
<li>Find the genre conventions </li>
<li>Look at the similarities</li>
<li>Start learning</li>
</ol>  
<p class= box> The bottom line is: use genre studies to simplify challenging definitions or actions in a discourse community. Although this might not work for everyone, trying it out might help you learn aspects of your discourse community quickly.</p>
